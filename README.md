# Welcome to my GitHub repository!
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is George Tan Juan Sheng, and I'm a 23-year-old CS fresh graduate from Monash University, currently working as a Backend Software Engineer at MoneyLion. I'm a tech enthusiast with a passion for building solutions that empower people.

ðŸ’« In this repository, you'll find a collection of projects that I've been working on recently. I'm a fast learner and I find it exciting to pick up things that I'm unfamiliar with!
