# Welcome to my GitHub repository!
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is George Tan Juan Sheng, and I'm a 23-year-old Software Engineer, currently working at [MoneyLion](https://www.moneylion.com/) as a Backend SWE. I'm a tech enthusiast with a passion for building solutions that empower people.

ðŸ’« In this repository, you'll find a collection of projects that I've been working on recently. I'm a fast learner and I find it exciting to pick up things that I'm unfamiliar with!

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach me at georgetan.business@gmail.com or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgetanjs/)!
