# Welcome to my GitHub repository!
👋 Hi, my name is George Tan Juan Sheng, and I'm a 22-year-old CS fresh graduate from Monash University. I'm a tech enthusiast with a passion for building solutions that empower people.

💫 I'm also a fast learner and I find it exciting to pick up things that I'm unfamiliar with!


💭 In this repository, you'll find a collection of projects that I've been working on as a fresh graduate. These projects demonstrate my skills and passion for technology, and I hope they'll give you a sense of the kind of work that I'm capable of.<br/>
<br/>
📫 Feel free to reach me at georgetan.business@gmail.com for jobs or networking purposes.
