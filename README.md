# Welcome to my GitHub repository!
👋 Hi, my name is George Tan Juan Sheng, and I'm a 22-year-old CS fresh graduate from Monash University. I'm a tech enthusiast with a passion for building solutions that empower people.<br/>
<br/>
💭 In this repository, you'll find a collection of projects that I've been working on as a fresh graduate. These projects demonstrate my skills and passion for technology, and I hope they'll give you a sense of the kind of work that I'm capable of.<br/>
<br/>
💫 Recently I've been working on a project that I've wanted to build for a very long time and I can't wait for it to be completed! Stay tuned!<br/>
